src:
	Stub classes and methods which conform to the assignment PFD.
	These are the classes and methods you need to complete

tests:
	The test files that have existed on the 504 website

kwic.txt:
	The text file you should be reading unless you created your own (the intent).
	You can use this file, or you can create one with similar format;
	i.e. a few lines of text with a variable number of words on each line.

projectlayout:
	A screenshot showing what your eclipse project should look like.
	It doesn't have to match exactly, but it should be very similar.

addingjunit5_1:
	Where to go in the menu to add junit5 (also called junit jupiter)
addingjunit5_2:
	Just create a temporary test file, in this case I called it "EXAMPLETest".
	The purposes here isn't to use this test file, but to pull the junit5 libraries
	into the class path which is required to use junit 5. If you have experience doing this already,
	there are other ways to add these libraries, but this is the most straightforward.
addingjunit5_3:
	Delete "EXAMPLETest", you're not using it.
	Now, the existing tests you downloaded from the 504 website should shot up without
	any errors since you have now included junit5 into the classpath.
	
Assignment 1.pdf:
	The existing assignment PDF
