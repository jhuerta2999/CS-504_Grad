I've chosen the client implementation method. There is no order that must be followed,
so the states don't need to know which state we are in. The context is not responsible either,
in order to do this I feel like the states would be able to jump from state to another, in other
words behave in an erratic behavior. Because the states are not dependent on each other and
the states dont jump from state to state we can simply create any order to get the answer we want.
We want the winning warrior from the duel and we simply get the winner of each fight, not going back
forth and not repeating/jumping states. The client should be responsible for knowing the state.
